Everyone of us has at least one best friend to share happiness and sadness. So do I. My best friend's name is Linh. I can say she is he closest friend until now since we were the children. We have grown up in the same town , went to same school and even studied in the same class. Linh is quite good-looking. She is looks tall and thin with round face, brown eyes and thin lips. She is a helpful and friendly girl. She has talent in Maths so sometimes when I get troubles , she always explains comlex Maths theories in the simple ways to help me understand. I like spending time with her because we have many things in common That's why she understands me including my hobbies and dislikes. The best character I like about her is the sense of humor. She always has useful ways to make me laugh whenever I'm sad or angry. I really treasure our friendship and hope that it will last forever.
